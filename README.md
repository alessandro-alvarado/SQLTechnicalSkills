<h1>SQL Technical Skills</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
As a highly skilled SQL developer, I have developed a robust understanding of SQL syntax and
the application of key SQL functions in real-world scenarios. The following is a detailed
summary of my core skills, including table creation, query writing, database manipulation, and
data integrity management.
<br />

<h2>Core Skills</h2>

<b>1.  Table Creation and Data Definition</b>
- Proficient in creating and managing relational database structures by designing tables
and defining data types

- Experienced with implementing primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure
data integrity.

- <b>Example:</b> Creation of customer, sales, employee, and department tables, defining
columns, primary keys, and relationships.
<br />

<b>2. Data Insertion and Updates</b>
- Skilled in inserting data into tables using INSERT INTO statements.

- Expertise in updating specific records based on conditions using UPDATE statements to
modify existing data.

- <b>Example:</b> Inserting records for a customer and updating sales dates in sales table.
<br />

<b>3. Querying Data</b>
- Proficient in constructing both simple and complex queries to retrieve specific data from
one or multiple tables.

- Able to use SELECT with multiple filtering conditions, sorting, and aggregation to extract
meaningful data.

- <b>Example:</b>  Querying inventory items, employee details, and order data using conditions
like date ranges and price filters.
<br />

<b>4. Join Operations</b>
- Experienced in performing inner and outer joins to combine data from multiple tables.

- Knowledgeable in handling one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships
with joins.

- <b>Example:</b>  Retrieving employee and department data using inner joins, selecting
consumers and orders using multi-table joins.
<br />

<b>5.  Data Manipulation and Integrity</b>
- Expertise in updating data types and column constraints using ALTER TABLE.

- Experienced with adding, renaming, and dropping columns, modifying column data
types, and applying constraints such as NOT NULL.

- <b>Example:</b>  Altering the customer table to modify column types and constraints, such as
changing ZIP code to CHAR(10).
<br />

<b>6. Delete Operations</b>
- Skilled in using DELETE statements to remove specific data while preserving database
integrity.

- <b>Example:</b>  Deleting records from the sales table based on conditions like sales ID.
<br />

<b>7. Database Normalization and Data Integrity</b>
- Understanding of database normalization principles to minimize data redundancy.

- Ability to design and maintain databases with normalized tables to ensure consistency
and integrity.
<br />

<b>8. Advanced SQL Features</b>
- Familiar with advanced SQL features, including aggregate functions, subqueries, and
data grouping.

- Expertise in using JOIN and GROUP BY to manipulate and summarize data for reporting
and analysis.

- <b>Example:</b>  Complex query for inventory analysis based on price and quantity.
<br />

<b>9. SQL Optimization</b>
- Capable of optimizing queries to improve performance, particularly when dealing with
large datasets or complex queries.
