<h1>SQL Technical Skills</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
As a highly skilled SQL developer, I have developed a robust understanding of SQL syntax and
the application of key SQL functions in real-world scenarios. The following is a detailed
summary of my core skills, including table creation, query writing, database manipulation, and
data integrity management.
<br />

<h2>Core Skills</h2>

<b>1.  Table Creation and Data Definition</b>
- Proficient in creating and managing relational database structures by designing tables
and defining data types

- Experienced with implementing primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure
data integrity.

- <b>Example:</b> Creation of customer, sales, employee, and department tables, defining
columns, primary keys, and relationships.
<br />

<b>2. Data Insertion and Updates</b>
- <b>Interface Design:</b> I implemented interfaces, such as the Habitat interface, to enforce
a contract for habitat size calculation and solitary status management across different
animal classes. This highlights my understanding of abstraction and modular design in
Java.
<br />

<b>3. Querying Data</b>
- <b>ArrayLists:</b> I utilized the ArrayList class to manage dynamic collections of objects.
For example, in the AnimalInventory class, I stored various animal objects and
manipulated them effectively using methods like .add() and .get() to demonstrate
my understanding of collections.

- <b>Iteration:</b> I used loops to iterate through lists of objects, enabling efficient data
processing. For example, in my figureSizes() method, I iterated over a list of
animals and calculated their required habitat size.
<br />

<b>4. Join Operations</b>
- <b>Overriding Methods:</b> I have demonstrated proficiency in overriding methods such as
toString(), calcSize(), and setSolitary() to provide specialized functionality
in each subclass. This allows my code to be flexible and adaptable to different animal
types while adhering to a common interface.

- <b>Polymorphism in Action:</b> I showcased polymorphism in the MyZoo class by creating a
single method (figureSizes()) that handles different types of animals, each with its
own implementation of calcSize(), allowing the system to process diverse objects in a
uniform way.
<br />

<b>5.  Data Manipulation and Integrity</b>
- <b>Class Construction:</b> I have designed well-structured classes with constructors that
initialize objects with specific attributes, ensuring the correct setup for each animal
object. I also used constructor chaining (super()) to call parent class constructors for
shared attributes.

- <b>Data Handling:</b> My projects involve managing various attributes for each animal type,
such as species, size, and social behavior. This demonstrates my ability to organize data
within objects and provide meaningful interactions between them.
<br />

<b>6. Delete Operations</b>
- <b>Code Organization:</b> I follow industry-standard Java conventions, such as appropriate
use of curly braces, indentation, and class/method naming. This makes my code easy to
read and maintain.

- <b>Comments & Documentation:</b> I ensure all key sections of my code are
well-commented, providing clear explanations for class designs, methods, and complex
logic. This enhances the maintainability of the code and ensures others can easily
understand and modify it if needed.
<br />

<b>7. Database Normalization and Data Integrity</b>

<b>8. Advanced SQL Features</b>

<b>9. SQL Optimization</b>
